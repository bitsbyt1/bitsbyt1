There was a boy. A boy, with a dream. A dream to clean, manipulate and gain insight off gigantic sets of data.

Yes, that boy is me, decades later, realizing that dream.  

I am a data scientist with a passion for storytelling. In todayâ€™s world, we are lucky to have more data than we know what to do with. Iâ€™d like to know how far that data can take us. How large insights can we gain? How many expensive mistakes can we avoid?

Being completely self-taught, my skillset includes the ability to generate insights out of datasets, right after cleaning them of course. I can analyze outliers in your data and help you decide what to do with them.

Iâ€™m also able to generate machine and deep learning algorithms that can take your data and create accurate predictions to help automate various decisions that would be time-consuming and expensive.

Outside of work, I like spending my time searching for awesome ice cream spots in LA, reading books, playing volleyball, Latin dancing, trying out new Trader Joeâ€™s snacks, and various other hobbies. Iâ€™m also currently learning to play the piano and binging Itâ€™s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

Most of my data science education has come from online platforms. I have taken courses on Codecademy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, YouTube, Udemy, and spent countless hours on sites like Codwars.

Iâ€™m extremely passionate about doing my part to help the world and the community. I like doing regular beach cleanups and helping people on Be My Eyes.

While Iâ€™m still only a year into my data science journey, Iâ€™m giving back to the community by writing blog posts to help other learners understand a lot of the concepts that I struggled with. Iâ€™m also trying to clean up messy datasets and upload them for free so other scientists can explore data without the hassle of having to clean it. Both the blog and datasets will be up shortly.

You can take a look at some of my projects on my Github. Feel free to download the code and explore it to your liking.

Iâ€™m looking forward to working with you.
